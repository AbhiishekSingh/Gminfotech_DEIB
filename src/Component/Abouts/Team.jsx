      details: `As a polio survivor, my personal journey has shaped my unwavering commitment to creating inclusive and accessible workplaces. Having experienced firsthand the barriers that individuals with disabilities and diverse backgrounds face, I turned my lived experiences into a powerful force for change.

With years of expertise in HR, DEIB strategies, and organizational transformation, I founded DEIB Innovation Lab to help businesses move beyond token efforts and implement real, measurable inclusion. My mission is simple: to break barriers, shift mindsets, and build a corporate world where everyone belongs.
