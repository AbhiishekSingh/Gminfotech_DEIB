          <h3>Data-driven</h3>
          <p>
            Our programs are based on peer-reviewed research, as well as actionable insights from practitioners in the field.<br />
            We measure starting points and track progress so you can see results from your efforts.<br />
            Our expert consultants do the heavy lifting to help you make sense of your data.

          <h3>Human-centered</h3>
          <p>
            There's a wide gap between knowing what needs to get done and actually motivating human beings to do it.<br />
            We leverage our experience in clinical psychology to break down barriers, guide difficult conversations, and motivate people to make real changes.

          <h3>Impact first</h3>
          <p>
            You can certainly keep yourself busy with a wide range of DEIB efforts, but are they actually making a difference?<br />
            We ensure that the answer is yes. That means we don’t sell services that have little impact (hello one-off trainings)<br />
            and challenge our clients to make meaningful change.
